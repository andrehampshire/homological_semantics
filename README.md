## Summary

This research introduces a novel theoretical framework that uses algebraic topology to model the structure of natural language. Drawing from nearly two decades of inquiry—beginning with the author’s emigration from Rio de Janeiro to the United States and shaped by years of teaching English—the paper develops a homological account of sentence meaning. In this model:

- **Nouns** are treated as volumetric entities with closed topological boundaries (β₃ = 1),
- **Verbs** are directional morphisms (β₁ = 1) connecting noun classes,
- **Adjectives** are epistemic loops that project variations of perceived identity,
- **Grammatical validity** corresponds to topological closure in the sentence’s structure.

By interpreting linguistic expressions as algebraic structures that either form or fail to form closed chains, this work reveals a powerful geometric basis for understanding syntax, semantics, and even cognitive perception.

The current version addresses sentence components such as nouns, verbs, adjectives, logical operators, clause embeddings, negation, quantifiers, and clause magnitude. Future expansions will include prepositional and participial phrases, pronouns, gerunds, relative clauses, and conjunctions.

This work was conducted entirely through autodidactic study, and it is shared in the hope that it may afford readers the same clarity and insight it has afforded the author.
